Hello. <!-- pls don't spam my mail -->

This is the site of a software developer, who has absolutely nothing to say, yet wanted a place to yap.

I tackle average problems in an averge job doing pretty average - and I love it. 
Software has been both my work life and passion for the last decade and a bit. I mainly program in C# at work, but greatly enjoy other languages as well if anything just for the sake of trying something different.

I would also like to mention that I like bugs - the living kind of bugs. And mushrooms.. So there might be posts along those lines occationally - you have been warned :)

~ enjoy
